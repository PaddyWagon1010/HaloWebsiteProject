        <h2>ODST Troopers</h2>
        <p>
          Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) are an elite and highly trained special operations force within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) in the "Halo" universe. Recognizable by their distinctive black armor and helmet with a glowing VISR (Visual Intelligence System, Reconnaissance) display, ODSTs are known for their exceptional combat skills and ability to conduct high-risk missions. What sets ODSTs apart is their unorthodox method of deploymentâ€”dropping from orbit directly into the heart of the battle using specialized drop pods. Led by officers like Gunnery Sergeants and First Lieutenants, ODSTs are often deployed independently or in small squads, displaying unmatched versatility in a variety of combat scenarios. Their resilience, adaptability, and commitment to completing missions make them a formidable force, earning them the nickname "Helljumpers" for their daring and unconventional tactics on the battlefield.
