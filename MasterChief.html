      <h2>John-117</h2>
      <p>
        Master Chief, also known as John-117, is the iconic protagonist of the Halo video game series developed by Bungie and later continued by 343 Industries. Clad in the formidable MJOLNIR powered armor, Master Chief is a supersoldier and the last of the SPARTAN-II program. His face remains obscured by his distinctive green helmet, contributing to the enigma surrounding his character. A silent and stoic warrior, Master Chief is known for his exceptional combat skills, leadership abilities, and unwavering dedication to humanity's survival in the face of relentless alien threats, notably the Covenant and the parasitic Flood. With his trusty AI companion Cortana, Master Chief embarks on epic journeys across the vast expanses of the Halo universe.
